    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Pumpkin soup is a usually 'bound' (thick) soup made from a purée of pumpkin. It is made 
        by combining the meat of a blended pumpkin with broth or stock. It can be served hot or cold,
         and is a popular Thanksgiving dish in the United States. Various versions
         of the dish are known in many European countries, the United States and other areas of North America,
          in Asia and in Australia.
